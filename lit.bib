abstract = {This paper provides evidence that free riders are heavily punished even if punishment is costly and does not provide any material benefits for the punisher. The more free riders negatively deviate from the group standard the more they are punished. As a consequence, the existence of an opportunity for costly punishment causes a large increase in cooperation levels because potential free riders face a credible threat. We show, in particular, that in the presence of a costly punishment opportunity almost complete cooperation can be achieved and maintained although, under the standard assumptions of rationality and selfishness, there should be no cooperation at all. We also show that free riding causes strong negative emotions among cooperators. The intensity of these emotions is the stronger the more the free riders deviate from the group standard. Our results provide, therefore, support for the hypothesis that emotions are guarantors of credible threats.},

Kooperation und Bestrafung im Public Good Experiment 

Es zeigt sich immer wieder, dass Teilnehmer Free-Rider bestrafen, auch wenn es kostspielig ist und sie keinen langfristigen Nutzen (materiell oder monet{\"{a}}r) davon tragen. Es gibt Hinweise daf{\"{u}}r, dass die H{\"{o}}he der Bestrafung linear zunimmt - je mehr sich die Free-Rider von der beigetragenen Menge unterscheiden, desto mehr werden sie bestraft. Das suggeriert, dass freeriding mit der Option zu bestrafen abnimmt. 
Public Good Experiment mit und ohne Bestrafung. Ohne Bestrafung: komplett freeriden ist dominante Strategie. In oneshot PB mit Bestrafung sollte es dieselbe Strategie wie eben (und bei egoistischen Spielern) sein. Aber das Beitragsverhalten geht hier stark auseinander! Ohne Bestrafung fallen die Beitr{\"{a}}ge mit der Zeit, mit Bestrafung gibt es Beitragsraten von 50-95{\%}.

Experimentelles Design
PB Experiment mit vier Treatments. Mit/Ohne Bestrafung und Partner/Strangersetting. Within-subject Vergleich von Beitragslevel, hat eine bessere Aussagekraft. 

Payoffs
(Gute Spielbeschreibung des PB, in BA: Beweis von MPCR als Fu{\ss}note?)

Result 1: Die Option zur Bestrafung bewirkt eine deutliche Steigerung zum durchschnittlichen Beitragslevel im Stranger-Treatment. Im Durchschnitt wurden 58{\%} vom Endowment beigetragen. 

Result 2: In der no-punishment Gruppe (Stranger) fielen die durschnittlichen Beitr{\"{a}}ge mit der Zeit, wohingegen im punishment Treatment die Beitr{\"{a}}ge nicht fallen, oder gar steigen.

Result 3: Im Stranger-Treatment mit PUN gibt es keine stabile Regulation des Verhaltens bez{\"{u}}glich individuelle Beitr{\"{a}}ge, wogegen im NoPUN treatment volles freeriden als Schwerpunkt der individuellen Aktion auftritt. 

Result 4: Die Existenz der Option zu bestrafen verursacht einen Anstieg im durschnittlichen Beitragsverhalten im Partner-Treatment. 

Result 5: Im NoPUN des Partner-Treatments konvergiert das Beitragsverhalten zu vollem freeriden, wogegen es beim PUN steigt und zu vollem Beitragsverhalten konvergiert.

Result 6: Im Partnertreatment mit PUN bekommt volles Beitragsverhalten die dominante Strategie f{\"{u}}r individuelle Beitr{\"{a}}ge, wogegen im NoPUN volles freeriden die allgemeine Aktion ist. 

Result 7: Im Stranger sowie im Partnertreatment werden die Teilnehmer mehr bestraft, je mehr diese ihre Beitr{\"{a}}ge unterm Durchschnitt der anderen w{\"{a}}hlen. Beitr{\"{a}}ge {\"{u}}ber dem Durchschnitt werden viel weniger bestraft. },

Conditional Cooperation, one-shot linear Public Goods Game mit einer Variante der Strategie-Methode von Selten. 1/3 sind Free Rider, 50{\%} CC. 14{\%} "hump-shaped"

Bei rationalen und egoistischen Individuen w{\"{u}}rde man von weniger Kooperation ausgehen. Die beobachtete Kooperation ist uneinheitlich und abnehmend im Zeitverlauf. M{\"{o}}gliche Erkl{\"{a}}rung: es gibt CC, also Leute, die bereit sind mehr beizutragen, je mehr die anderen beitragen. CC kann als eine Motivation an sich betrachtet werden oder als eine Konsequenz einiger Fairness-Pr{\"{a}}ferenzen wie Altruismus, Warmherzigkeit, Ungleichheitsaversion oder Reziprozit{\"{a}}t. 

Strategiemethode von Selten (1967) wird implementiert, um die Pr{\"{a}}ferenzen der Teilnehmer heraus zu filtern, Unconditional contribution und contribution table. Teilnehmer treffen beide Entscheidungen, ohne das die Entscheidungen der anderen bekannt ist. Dadurch wird der Plan der Teilnehmer aufgedeckt.
Damit das Experiment anreizvertr{\"{a}}glich bleibt und die Teilnehmer ihre wahren Entscheidungen berichten (und die Fragen ernst nehmen), wird Ihnen gesagt, dass eine ihrer beiden Entscheidungen am Ende zuf{\"{a}}llig ausgelost und bezahlt wird. In jeder Gruppe wird f{\"{u}}r einen der vier Teilnehmer zuf{\"{a}}llig die Beitragstabelle relevant. F{\"{u}}r die anderen drei wird ihre unconditional contribution relevant. Also ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass die Beitragstabelle f{\"{u}}r eine Person wichtig wird, 25{\%}. Das sichert, dass sowohl alle Eintr{\"{a}}ge in der Tabelle als auch die unconditionellen Beitr{\"{a}}ge Payoff-relevant sind.

abstract = {Human cooperation is an evolutionary puzzle. Unlike other creatures, people frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. These patterns of cooperation cannot be explained by the nepotistic motives associated with the evolutionary theory of kin selection and the selfish motives associated with signalling theory or the theory of reciprocal altruism. Here we show experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain. We show that cooperation flourishes if altruistic punishment is possible, and breaks down if it is ruled out. The evidence indicates that negative emotions towards defectors are the proximate mechanism behind altruistic punishment. These results suggest that future study of the evolution of human cooperation should include a strong focus on explaining altruistic punishment.},

However, the data also reveal a sizable share of free-riders that punish pro-socially and conditional cooperators that do not engage in punishment.

The treatment variable is the distribution of high and low effort cost across subjects. We present data for one, two and three low-cost subjects as well as control sessions with symmetric costs. The overall pattern of coordination improvement is common across treatments. Early coordination improvements depend on the distribution of high and low effort costs across subjects, but these differences disappear with time. We find that initial leadership in overcoming coordination failure is not driven by low-cost subjects but by subjects with the most common cost type. This conformity effect may be due to a kind of group identity or to the cognitive simplicity of acting with identical others.},

While most groups first experience inefficient coordination in a baseline treatment, the efficiency increases substantially once ex post sanctioning opportunities are introduced, that is, when one can assign costly punishment points to other group members in order to reduce their payoffs. We compare the effect of this voluntary punishment possibility with the effect of ex post costless communica- tion: in contrast to the punishment treatment, the latter only temporarily increases efficiency and fails to do so permanently. This suggests that decentralized sanctions can play an important role as a coordination device in Pareto-ranked coordination settings, such as teamwork in firms and other organizational contexts.},

In each case, however, a change in the payoff structure produces a large inconsistency between theoretical predictions and observed behavior. These con- tradictions are generally consistent with simple intuition based on the interaction of payoff asymmetries and noisy introspection about others' decisions.},

@article{Bardsley2000,
abstract = {Lying to participants offers an experimenter the enticing prospect of making “others' behaviour” a controlled variable, but is eschewed by experimental economists because it may pollute the pool of subjects. This paper proposes and implements a new experimental design, the Conditional Information Lottery, which offers all the benefits of deception without actually deceiving anyone. The design should be suitable for most economics experiments, and works by a modification of an already standard device, the Random Lottery incentive system. The deceptive scenarios of designs which use deceit are replaced with fictitious scenarios, each of which, from a subject's viewpoint, has a chance of being true. The design is implemented in a sequential play public good experiment prompted byWeimann's (1994) result, from a deceptive design, that subjects are more sensitive to free- riding than cooperation on the part of others. The experiment provides similar results toWeimann's, in that subjects are at least as cooperative when uninformed about others' behaviour as they are if reacting to high contributions. No deception is used and the data cohere well both internally and with other public goods experiments. In addition, simultaneous play is found to be more efficient than sequential play, and subjects contribute less at the end of a sequence than at the start. The results suggest pronounced elements of overconfidence, egoism and (biased) reciprocity in behaviour, which may explain decay in contributions in repeated play designs. The experiment shows there is a workable alternative to deception.},

abstract = {We document the widespread existence of antisocial punishment, that is, the sanctioning of people who behave prosocially. Our evidence comes from public goods experiments that we conducted in 16 comparable participant pools around the world. However, there is a huge cross-societal variation. Some participant pools punished the high contributors as much as they punished the low contributors, whereas in others people only punished low contributors. In some participant pools, antisocial punishment was strong enough to remove the cooperation-enhancing effect of punishment. We also show that weak norms of civic cooperation and the weakness of the rule of law in a country are significant predictors of antisocial punishment. Our results show that punishment opportunities are socially beneficial only if complemented by strong social norms of cooperation.},

@article{Milinski2002,
abstract = {The problem of sustaining a public resource that everybody is free to overuse-the 'tragedy of the commons'-emerges in many social dilemmas, such as our inability to sustain the global climate. Public goods experiments, which are used to study this type of problem, usually confirm that the collective benefit will not be produced. Because individuals and countries often participate in several social games simultaneously, the interaction of these games may provide a sophisticated way by which to maintain the public resource. Indirect reciprocity, 'give and you shall receive', is built on reputation and can sustain a high level of cooperation, as shown by game theorists. Here we show, through alternating rounds of public goods and indirect reciprocity games, that the need to maintain reputation for indirect reciprocity maintains contributions to the public good at an unexpectedly high level. But if rounds of indirect reciprocation are not expected, then contributions to the public good drop quickly to zero. Alternating the games leads to higher profits for all players. As reputation may be a currency that is valid in many social games, our approach could be used to test social dilemmas for their solubility.},

abstract = {There is strong evidence that people exploit their bargaining power in competitive markets but not in bilateral bargaining situations. There is also strong evidence that people exploit free-riding opportunities in voluntary cooperation games. Yet, when they are given the opportunity to punish free-riders, stable cooperation is maintained although punishment is costly for those who punish. This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence. We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selfish types dominate equilibrium behavior.},

abstract = {This paper highlights the potential for joint OECD (or non-OPEC) carbon taxes to reduce OPEC{\^{a}}€™s monopoly rent and provide benefit to non-OPEC countries provided jointly agreed trigger strategies are adhered to. In traditional economic theory, the primary purpose of a carbon tax is to internalize a global negative externality. A second benefit for individual countries is that the revenue raised by carbon tax can be used to reduce other tax rates and so lower the deadweight loss of tax system. In this paper, we discuss a third benefit of carbon taxes: transferring rents from OPEC to the oil importing countries. We develop a multi-region general equilibrium structure with endogenously determined oil supply for the purpose in which emissions are endogenously determined. We calibrate our model to 2006 data. Our analytics and numerical simulation results highlight how a uniform carbon tax used by all non-OPEC countries will increase the buyer{\^{a}}€™s price of oil but decrease the supplier{\^{a}}€™s price of oil, thus decreasing non-OPEC countries{\^{a}}€™ oil demand, and transferring OPEC monopoly rent to non-OPEC countries. Carbon taxes reduce the welfare of OPEC and increase the welfare of non-OPEC countries. Results also show how carbon taxes reduce global emissions, but the effect is small.},
